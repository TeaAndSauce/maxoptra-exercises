# MaxOptra Submission - George Robinson

Hey there, George here. I just wanted to take a moment to thank you for giving me the opportunity to present my skills and potentially jump aboard MaxOptra. 

Some things you must note before running this project:

 - I did not implement CSV uploading.
 - I did not attempt the third exercise (UI test).
 - I did not implement a login system with session management due to the fact that there was no requirement to persist data into a database.

I want to show my interest and capabilities by submitting some work for you to have a look at, but at the same time I do not want to spend too long on the project and potentially miss out on the role because I took too long. This is why I chose to skip the CSV upload for now, but I will more than likely roll the new changes out on Monday with the CSV upload feature completed.

I'm really keen to meet with you again, talk about the challenges faced along the way and what I would also do differently if I had more time or if the requirements were altered.

## **Exercise 1:**

Requirements:
 - Amazon Corretto v18.0.1 JDK (Downloadable within IntelliJ)
 - Node (latest)

**Steps to run (backend):**

 1. Open project with IntelliJ
 2. Go to project structure and select the JDK to be "corretto-18", which is the Amazon Corretto JDK. If you do not find it, you can add it through IntelliJ.
 3. Once the project has indexed, locate `Test1Application` in `com.maxoptra.test1` package.
 4. Click run.

This should start the backend.

**Steps to run (frontend):**

 1. Ensure you have the latest version of node installed
 2. Locate the frontend folder
 3. Run the command `npm install` in the frontend project folder
 4. Wait for npm to install the project
 5. In the root project folder (frontend), use the command `nx serve` to start the server

To answer the questions I know will probably pop up:

**George, you have built this application and there's so much boilerplate - was Nx Workspace really necessary?** Absolutely not but I just love Nx as it helps with my productivity as I know where everything is and there is a lot of modern tooling.

**I'm new to Angular, where are the files you worked on specifically for the frontend?** 
Go to libs -> card-viewer -> src -> lib

## **Exercise 2:**
This was a fun little exercise, was a lot faster to implement than the previous. Once again I used the Amazon Corretto 18.0.1 JDK which was installed through IntelliJ.

To run this project, locate the Exercises 2 folder and open the terminal in this location. Type the following:

 1. `javac Main.java`
 2. `java Main <input>` where input is any integer or non-integer. 

Thank you for your time, and I hope I hear back from you soon! ðŸ‘‹
